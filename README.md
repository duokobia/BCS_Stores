## What is this ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

I built this skeletal product at my spare time to showcase how my software development skills can be used to create business solutions. Given more resources, a more robust and beautiful website will be built in record time.

## Features

- Proven, scalable, and easy to understand project structure
- Written in modern React, only functional components with hooks
- A variety of custom light-weight UI components such as datepicker, modal, various form elements etc
- Simple local React state management, with redux, mobx, or similar
- Webpack setup with create-react-app
- Client written in Babel powered JavaScript
- API written in JavaScript.

## Setting up development environment üõ†

- `git clone https://github.com/duokobia/bcs-stores.git`
- `npm run install-dependencies`
- `cd api && npm start`
- `cd client && npm start` in another terminal tab
- App should now be running on `http://localhost:3000/`

## What's missing?

Features missing from this showcase product which should exist in a real product includes:

- payment gateway
- xxx
- yyy
- zzz
